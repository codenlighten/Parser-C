Below is a tailored roadmap for your development team to build a lean LLVM replacement for C code. This version is streamlined for a team of developers, with clear milestones, assigned roles, and timelines, assuming a small-to-medium team (e.g., 3-5 developers) with varying expertise. It’s designed to be actionable, collaborative, and focused on delivering a functional, lightweight compiler infrastructure. I’ll assume your team wants to prioritize speed of development and a minimal viable product (MVP) that can grow over time.
Roadmap for Development Team: Lean LLVM Replacement for C
Project Overview

    Goal: Build a lightweight, C-specific compiler to replace LLVM’s complexity for simple use cases (e.g., embedded systems, small utilities).
    Target Features: C parser, minimal IR, x86-64 codegen, basic optimizations.
    Success Criteria: Compile a 100-line C program in 6 months with a binary <1 MB and faster compile time than Clang.

Team Roles

    Lead Architect: Oversees design, IR, and integration; resolves technical disputes.
    Frontend Dev(s): Focus on C parser and AST generation.
    Backend Dev(s): Handle IR-to-codegen and target architecture support.
    Optimizer Dev: Implements minimal optimizations and performance tuning.
    Tester/QA: Builds test suite, benchmarks, and validates output.

Phase 1: Planning and Setup (Weeks 1-2)

Goal: Align team, set up infrastructure, and finalize design.

    Kickoff Meeting (Lead Architect):
        Define scope: C-only, x86-64 target, no JIT, minimal optimizations.
        Agree on language (e.g., C for simplicity or Rust for safety).
        Assign roles and responsibilities.
    Design Specs (Lead Architect + Team):
        Sketch a simple IR (e.g., three-address code: add r1, r2, r3).
        Plan a modular structure: parser → AST → IR → codegen.
    Setup (All Devs):
        Create repo (e.g., GitHub) with basic build system (Make).
        Establish coding standards and testing framework (e.g., unit tests in CUnit).

Deliverables:

    Project repo with README.
    High-level architecture doc (1-2 pages).
    Initial commit with skeleton code.

Phase 2: Frontend Development (Weeks 3-6)

Goal: Parse basic C code into an AST.

    Parser Development (Frontend Devs):
        Build a recursive descent parser for a C subset:
            Basic types (int, char), functions, if, while, return.
            No structs or pointers yet.
        Output a minimal AST (e.g., nodes for expressions, statements).
    Testing (Tester/QA):
        Write test cases: int main() { return 42; }, simple arithmetic.
        Verify AST correctness with manual inspection or dumps.

Deliverables:

    Parser that handles a "Hello, World" equivalent.
    5-10 test cases passing.

Milestone: Parse int main() { int x = 5; return x; } successfully.
Phase 3: IR and Codegen Foundation (Weeks 7-12)

Goal: Translate AST to IR and generate x86-64 assembly.

    IR Design and Implementation (Lead Architect + Backend Devs):
        Define a lean IR (e.g., mov r1, 5; add r2, r1, 3).
        Write AST-to-IR converter for basic operations.
    Codegen (Backend Devs):
        Map IR to x86-64 assembly (e.g., mov eax, 5; ret).
        Output text assembly, rely on as and ld for linking.
    Integration (Lead Architect):
        Connect parser → AST → IR → codegen pipeline.
        Test end-to-end with a trivial program.
    Testing (Tester/QA):
        Run generated binary and verify output (e.g., exit code 42).
        Add regression tests for each stage.

Deliverables:

    Working pipeline for int main() { return 42; }.
    Assembly output that runs on x86-64.

Milestone: Compile and execute a static C program returning a constant.
Phase 4: Expand Functionality (Weeks 13-20)

Goal: Support variables, control flow, and functions.

    Frontend Enhancements (Frontend Devs):
        Add support for local variables, if/else, and while loops.
        Extend AST and parser accordingly.
    IR and Codegen Updates (Backend Devs):
        Add IR instructions for jumps and conditionals (e.g., cmp, jne).
        Implement basic stack frame setup for functions (e.g., push rbp).
    Testing (Tester/QA):
        Test programs with loops (e.g., sum 1 to 10) and function calls.
        Benchmark compile time vs. Clang on small files.

Deliverables:

    Compile a program like:
    c

    int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
    int main() { return add(2, 3); }

Milestone: Compile a 50-line C program with functions and loops.
Phase 5: Basic Optimizations and Polish (Weeks 21-26)

Goal: Add minimal optimizations and stabilize.

    Optimizations (Optimizer Dev):
        Implement constant folding (e.g., x = 2 + 3 → x = 5).
        Add dead code elimination (e.g., remove unused assignments).
    Codegen Refinement (Backend Devs):
        Simple register allocation (e.g., fixed registers or greedy assignment).
        Reduce assembly verbosity where possible.
    Polish (All Devs):
        Fix bugs from test feedback.
        Optimize compiler memory usage and speed.
    Testing and Benchmarking (Tester/QA):
        Compile a 100-line embedded-style C program (e.g., LED blinker).
        Compare binary size and compile time to Clang.

Deliverables:

    Compiler with -O1-level optimizations.
    Binary under 1 MB, compiles faster than Clang for small files.

Milestone: Compile a practical 100-line C program correctly.
Phase 6: Release and Next Steps (Weeks 27-30)

Goal: Ship v0.1 and plan future work.

    Documentation (Lead Architect + Team):
        Write usage guide (e.g., leancc file.c -o out).
        Document limitations (e.g., no pointers yet).
    Release (All Devs):
        Tag v0.1 in repo.
        Publish to GitHub with prebuilt binary for x86-64.
    Retrospective (Team):
        Assess what worked and what didn’t.
        Plan next features (e.g., pointers, ARM support).

Deliverables:

    v0.1 release with source and binary.
    Roadmap for v0.2 (e.g., structs, preprocessor).

Milestone: Publicly available compiler that builds simple C code.
Timeline Summary

    Weeks 1-2: Planning (2 weeks).
    Weeks 3-6: Frontend (4 weeks).
    Weeks 7-12: IR + Codegen (6 weeks).
    Weeks 13-20: Expansion (8 weeks).

Resource Notes

    Team Size: 3-5 devs (1 lead, 1-2 frontend, 1-2 backend, 1 tester).
    Dependencies: Minimal—use standard C libs, avoid LLVM/Clang code.
    Hardware: x86-64 dev machines; test on Linux initially.

Risks and Mitigations

    Parser Complexity: Start with C subset, expand later.
    Codegen Bugs: Test small units early, rely on existing assemblers.
    Team Bottlenecks: Pair devs on tricky tasks (e.g., IR design).
