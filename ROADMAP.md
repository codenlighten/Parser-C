# LLVM Replacement Project Roadmap

## Project Goals
- Create lightweight C compiler
- Target x86-64 architecture
- Binary size < 1MB
- Faster compilation than Clang
- Timeline: 30 weeks

## Phase 1: Planning & Setup (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] Project kickoff meeting
- [ ] Define architecture and IR design
- [ ] Set up repository and build system
- [ ] Establish coding standards
- [ ] Create initial test framework

## Phase 2: Frontend (Weeks 3-6)
- [ ] Implement recursive descent parser
  - [ ] Basic types (int, char)
  - [ ] Functions
  - [ ] If/while statements
- [ ] Build AST generator
- [ ] Create parser test suite
- [ ] Milestone: Parse basic C program

## Phase 3: IR & Codegen (Weeks 7-12)
- [ ] Design IR format
- [ ] Implement AST to IR conversion
- [ ] Create x86-64 code generator
- [ ] Set up assembler integration
- [ ] Milestone: Generate working binary

## Phase 4: Core Functionality (Weeks 13-20)
- [ ] Add variable support
- [ ] Implement control flow
- [ ] Add function calls
- [ ] Create stack frame handling
- [ ] Milestone: Compile 50-line program

## Phase 5: Optimization (Weeks 21-26)
- [ ] Implement constant folding
- [ ] Add dead code elimination
- [ ] Create basic register allocation
- [ ] Optimize compiler performance
- [ ] Milestone: Compile 100-line program

## Phase 6: Release (Weeks 27-30)
- [ ] Complete documentation
- [ ] Create usage guide
- [ ] Package v0.1 release
- [ ] Plan v0.2 features
