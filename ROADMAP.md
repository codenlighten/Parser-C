# LeanCC Compiler Project Roadmap

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Planning 
- Basic project structure and build system 
- Initial documentation 
- Development environment setup 

## Phase 2: Frontend Development (Current Phase)
### Lexer and Parser
- Basic lexical analysis 
- Token types and management 
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) design 
- Core C syntax support:
  - Binary operators (+, -, *, /) with precedence 
  - Variable declarations and assignments 
  - Control flow statements (if/else, while) 
  - Function calls and definitions 
  - Symbol table with scope management 
  - Error handling with descriptive messages 

### Next Immediate Tasks
1. Parser Testing and Validation
   - Create comprehensive test suite for all implemented features
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Validate AST structure for complex programs
   - Add test coverage metrics

2. Parser Optimization
   - Implement error recovery mechanisms
   - Optimize memory usage in AST construction
   - Profile and improve parsing performance
   - Clean up remaining compiler warnings

3. IR Design and Planning
   - Document IR requirements and constraints
   - Design IR instruction set
   - Plan IR optimization passes
   - Create IR builder interface

## Phase 3: IR Generation (Next Phase)
- IR instruction set implementation
- AST to IR translation
- Basic IR optimizations
- IR validation and testing

## Phase 4: Backend Development
- Target architecture selection
- Code generation framework
- Register allocation
- Basic optimizations
- Assembly output

## Phase 5: Optimization and Enhancement
- Advanced optimizations
- Debug information
- Error recovery
- Performance improvements

## Phase 6: Testing and Documentation
- Comprehensive test suite
- Documentation updates
- Performance benchmarks
- Example programs

## Target Release: October 2025

## Current Status (as of March 13, 2025)
- Phase 2 (Frontend Development) in progress
- Major parser features completed
- Moving to testing and optimization phase
- IR design planning to begin soon

## Next Milestone
- Complete parser testing and validation
- Begin IR design and implementation
- Target: April 2025
